sudo apt update :
updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.

sudo apt upgrade :
actually installs newer versions of the packages you have. After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the software you have installed.

sudo apt dist-upgrade :
Will not upgrade to a new Ubuntu release. It will just install available updates for the Ubuntu release you already have installed.

sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade && sudo apt autoremove
